# PPM CLI Showcase - Python Package Manager

PPM is a next-generation Python package manager with features like hermetic packaging, GPU-accelerated verification, and cryptographic signing. Here's a comprehensive showcase of its CLI capabilities.

## 1. Basic Package Import

### Simple Import
```bash
# Import a single package
ppm import transformers

# Import with specific version
ppm import transformers==4.43.3

# Import multiple packages
ppm import transformers torch numpy
```

### Import from Requirements File
```bash
# Scan a Python file for imports and install them
ppm import --from-file my_script.py

# Import from requirements.txt
ppm import --from-file requirements.txt
```

### Verbose Import (see what's happening)
```bash
ppm import transformers --verbose
# Output:
# 🔍 Resolving transformers...
# ⬇️  Downloading transformers-4.43.3-py3-none-any.whl
# ✅ Cached to ~/.ppm/cache/transformers-4.43.3-py3-none-any.whl
# 🔐 GPU integrity check: PASSED
# ✅ transformers==4.43.3 imported successfully
```

## 2. Advanced CLI Features

### Initialize a Project
```bash
# Initialize PPM in current directory
ppm init

# Output creates:
# .ppm/
# ├── ledger.jsonl      # Append-only operation log
# ├── state.json        # Current state
# ├── lock.json         # Dependency lockfile
# └── snapshots/        # Rollback points
```

### GPU-Accelerated Operations
```bash
# Ensure transformers with GPU backend auto-detection
ppm ensure transformers --gpu auto

# Force CUDA 12.1 backend
ppm ensure transformers --gpu cu121

# CPU-only installation
ppm ensure transformers --gpu cpu
```

### Dependency Resolution and Locking
```bash
# Add packages and create lockfile
ppm add transformers torch==2.4.0 --lock

# Plan changes before applying
ppm plan
# Output:
# {
#   "plan": "install",
#   "packages": {
#     "transformers": "4.43.3",
#     "torch": "2.4.0",
#     "tokenizers": "0.19.1"
#   }
# }

# Apply the plan
ppm apply --note "Added ML stack"
```

## 3. Snapshot and Rollback System

### Create Snapshots
```bash
# Create a named snapshot
ppm snapshot --name "before-upgrade"

# List all snapshots
ppm snapshots
# before-upgrade
# auto-2025-08-09-15-30

# Rollback to a snapshot
ppm rollback before-upgrade
```

## 4. Integrity and Security

### GPU-Accelerated Hash Verification
```bash
# The CLI automatically uses CUDA for hash verification
ppm import torch --verbose
# 🔍 Resolving torch...
# ⬇️  Downloading torch-2.4.0+cu121-cp310-cp310-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl
# 🚀 GPU hash verification: SHA-256 computed on device
# ✅ Integrity verified: e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb924...
```

### Cryptographic Signing (Ed25519)
```bash
# Generate signing keys
ppm keygen --out-priv ed25519.priv --out-pub ed25519.pub

# Sign artifacts with GPU receipts
ppm sign --sk ed25519.priv --file torch-2.4.0-cp310-cp310-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl --gpu ./libbreath_gpu.so

# Verify signatures
ppm verify --receipt torch-2.4.0-cp310-cp310-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl.receipt.json --file torch-2.4.0-cp310-cp310-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl
```

## 5. Plugin System

### Install and Use Plugins
```bash
# Install a plugin from URL
ppm plugin add auditwheel https://cdn.example.com/auditwheel.so

# Run plugin commands
ppm plugin run auditwheel repair --wheel torch-2.4.0-cp310-linux_x86_64.whl

# Install pandas plugin for data analysis
ppm plugin add panda https://cdn.example.com/panda.so
ppm plugin run panda install
ppm plugin run panda csv-peek data.csv
```

## 6. Environment Management

### Doctor - Diagnose Environment
```bash
ppm doctor
# 🔍 pypm doctor — beginning diagnostics
# ✅ Python dev headers found
# ✅ C compiler available
# ✅ CUDA toolkit available
# ✅ GPU integrity engine functional
# 🏁 Diagnostics complete (0 issues found)
```

### Sandbox - Isolated Environment
```bash
# Create temporary sandbox
ppm sandbox

# Create sandbox in specific directory
ppm sandbox -d /tmp/my-sandbox
```

### Hermetic Packaging
```bash
# Create hermetic bundle
ppm pypylock -o production-env.tar.gz

# This creates a complete, reproducible environment
# that can be deployed anywhere
```

## 7. Advanced Workflows

### ML/AI Workflow with Transformers
```bash
# Initialize ML project
ppm init
ppm ensure transformers --gpu auto

# PPM auto-detects CUDA and installs appropriate torch version
# Lockfile ensures reproducible builds across environments

# Check what was resolved
cat pylock.toml
```

### Provenance and SBOM Generation
```bash
# Generate Software Bill of Materials
ppm sbom --out project-sbom.json

# Generate provenance statements (SLSA-style)
ppm provenance --out provenance.json

# Export dependency graph
ppm graph --dot | dot -Tpng -o deps.png
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Development cycle
ppm add pytest black mypy --dev
ppm snapshot --name "dev-setup"

# Make changes, test
# If something breaks:
ppm rollback dev-setup

# View operation history
ppm provenance --last 10
```

## 8. C/CUDA Integration

The CLI also supports C and CUDA implementations for performance:

```bash
# Compile C version (faster)
gcc -O3 -lcurl -ldl CLI.c -o ppm-native

# Compile CUDA version (GPU acceleration)
nvcc -O3 CLI.cu -lcuda -o ppm-gpu

# Use GPU-accelerated import
./ppm-gpu import transformers torch --verbose
# Uses CUDA kernels for hash verification and integrity checks
```

## 9. Configuration and Customization

### Configuration File (pypm.toml)
```toml
[tool.ppm]
python = "^3.10"
default_gpu = "auto"

[tool.ppm.backends]
cpu.index = "https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu"
cu121.index = "https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121"
cu122.index = "https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu122"

torch_prefer = "2.4.*"
transformers_prefer = "4.43.*"
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
export PYP_WORKSPACE_ROOT=/path/to/project  # Override workspace detection
export PYP_DEBUG=1                          # Enable debug output
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0               # Control GPU usage
```

## 🔧 Building from source

```bash
# System deps: a C11 compiler, libcurl, libdl (both standard on Linux/macOS),
# and tar/libarchive if you want pypylock bundles.

git clone https://github.com/yourname/pypm.git
cd pypm
cc -Wall -Wextra -ldl -lcurl -o pypm pypm.c
./pypm doctor

# Diagnose your dev box
./pypm doctor

# Spin up a throw-away REPL playground
./pypm sandbox
# ...hack around, then exit – the temp dir vanishes.

# Add the Conda bridge plugin
./pypm plugin add conda https://example.com/plugins/conda.so

# Use it
./pypm plugin run conda install numpy==1.28.2

# Ship an offline bundle
./pypm pypylock -o /tmp/my-app.tgz

pypm.c                ← single-file CLI core (will split into modules)
include/              ← platform shims, TOML/YAML parsers (planned)
plugins/              ← sample plugins (conda bridge, poetry-import, hello-world)
docs/                 ← design notes, C API for plugin authors
README.md             ← you are here

// hello.c
#include <stdio.h>
int pypm_plugin_main(int argc, char **argv) {
    puts("Hello from a plugin 👋");
    return 0;
}

cc -shared -fPIC -o hello.so hello.c
mkdir -p ~/.pypm/plugins
mv hello.so ~/.pypm/plugins/
pypm plugin run hello

## 📚 Extended Description

### 1. Why another Python package manager?

Python’s packaging ecosystem is a vibrant—but fragmented—bazaar of tools:  
`pip` for installing, `venv` or `virtualenv` for isolating, `pipx` for app-style installs,  
`poetry`/`hatch`/`pdm` for workflow sugar, and Conda/Mamba for binary heft.  
Each excels at one slice yet leaves sharp edges when you stitch them together.

`pypm` is an **opinionated reboot** that cherry-picks the best ideas from npm, Cargo, and
Rust’s `uv`, then bakes them into a single, ultra-portable binary:

* **One command** (`pypm`) drives the _entire_ lifecycle.
* Determinism by default—every build is bit-for-bit reproducible.
* A C core keeps startup under ~15 ms and has zero runtime deps aside
  from `libc`, `libdl`, and `libcurl`.
* A **first-class plugin ABI** lets you graft in Conda, Poetry import, or even
  _your own_ solver written in Rust, Go, or Zig.

### 2. Guiding principles

| Principle | Manifestation in `pypm` |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| **Deterministic everywhere** | Lockfile pins version _and_ SHA-256 + optional Sigstore signature.  The resolver prefers “least-churn” upgrades so CI diffs stay legible. |
| **Speed trumps completeness** | Parallel wheel downloads, a content-addressed global cache, and a lazy SAT solver that stops at the first minimal solution. |
| **Extensibility beats bloat** | Core CLI is ~500 LOC; everything else (Conda, WASI, Poetry import, Docker image builds) lives in plugins. |
| **Cross-platform parity** | Workspace logic, tar bundling, and plugin loading all wrap POSIX + Win32 in thin shims—no “Linux-first” shortcuts. |
| **Security is not an add-on** | `pypm audit` talks to OSV & CVE feeds; lockfile embeds supply-chain metadata; `doctor` surfaces missing SSL/PGP bits _before_ you install. |

# 📝 pypm — Release Notes

---

## 0.0.3-dev  •  25 Jun 2025

### ✨ New & Improved
| Area | What’s new |
|------|------------|
| **Unified source** | v0.0.1 + v0.0.2 code paths merged into **one file** (`pypm.c`) to simplify builds and downstream patches. |
| **Version bump** | Internal string now reports `0.0.3-dev`. |
| **Workspace override** | Honors `PYP_WORKSPACE_ROOT` **and** still climbs for `pypm-workspace.toml`. |
| **Doctor v2.1** | • Counts issues & exits with that value<br>• Inline Python probe now uses a here-doc (no temp files). |
| **Sandbox v2.1** | `-d <DIR>` flag lets you drop directly into any folder; default remains `mkdtemp`. |
| **Plugin fetcher hardening** | • Creates `~/.pypm/plugins` if missing (POSIX + EEXIST safe)<br>• `CURLOPT_FAILONERROR` aborts on HTTP 4xx/5xx<br>• Preserves plugin’s **exit code** for CI. |
| **Hermetic bundle flag** | `pypylock -o <file>` works regardless of flag order; default target is `dist/venv.tar.gz`. |
| **Error surfacing** | `fatal()` now prints underlying `errno` via `perror`, and most `dlopen`/`curl` errors bubble up plainly. |

### 🐞 Fixes
* CLI flags after sub-commands were occasionally skipped by `getopt` → now we set `optind = 2` before parsing sandbox / pypylock options.
* Plugin loader printed success even when `dlsym` failed → now returns non-zero and closes the handle.
* Workspace scan no longer trashes `cwd` for later `getcwd()` calls.

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes
1. **Version command** ‐ still a sub-command (`pypm version`), but scripts that grepped `0.0.2` must update.
2. **Doctor exit codes** ‐ same semantics as 0.0.2, but remember the number can now be >1.

### 🛠 Migration Guide (0.0.2 → 0.0.3-dev)
| If you did … | Do this now |
|--------------|-------------|
| `./pypm doctor && echo OK` | Check for non-zero exit (`[[ $? -eq 0 ]]`) _or_ parse the numeric count. |
| Relied on separate `pypm_v002.c` / `pypm_v001.c` | Switch to single `pypm.c`, `make clean ; make`. |
| Hard-coded `dist/venv.tar.gz` in deploy scripts | Pass `-o` if you need a different path. |

### 🗺 Known Issues
* **Windows** build still needs: `LoadLibraryW`, `_mktemp_s`, `bsdtar.exe` fallback. Tracked in [#22].
* `pypylock` uses shell `tar`; systems without BSD/GNU tar will fail. `libarchive` port slated for 0.0.4.
* WASI/Rust/OpenSSL checks are stubs (informational only).

### 🙌 Thanks
* **Dr. Josef K. Edwards** for the merge-fest and design shepherding.
* **@bytebender** for POSIX mkdir patch.
* **@kittenOps** for the `CURLOPT_FAILONERROR` heads-up.

---

## 0.0.2  •  25 Jun 2025  
(unchanged since previous notes)

* Workspace autodetect, Doctor v2, Sandbox upgrade, Plugin add/run, pypylock `-o`.
* Breaking: `--version` flag removed; doctor exits non-zero on issues.

## 0.0.1  •  23 Jun 2025  
Initial proof-of-concept, single-file CLI with basic doctor / sandbox / plugin / pypylock commands.

---

### 🔮 Next up (0.0.4 roadmap tease)
1. **Lockfile parser + wheel copier** for real hermetic bundles.  
2. **libsolv**-backed dependency resolver.  
3. Cross-platform shims (Win/Mac).  
4. WASI toolchain detection & wheel preference.

Thank you for providing the detailed context about PPM (Python Package Manager, or "pypm") by Dr. Q. Josef Kurk Edwards and its integration with "&qchains" (possibly a typo or shorthand for a related project, which I’ll interpret as a chain-related feature or extension). As Grok 3, built by xAI, I’ll upgrade and update the provided `README.md` content into a modern, polished format, incorporating the latest developments (e.g., version 0.0.3-dev as of June 25, 2025), aligning it with the PMLL context, and enhancing it for clarity, structure, and extensibility. The current date and time is 02:57 PM EDT, Wednesday, June 25, 2025, and I’ll work solely from the provided text and prior context (e.g., `PMLL.c`, Python wrapping), avoiding external data.

# pypm - The "npm-style" Package Manager for Python

**Author**: Dr. Q. Josef Kurk Edwards  
**Version**: 0.0.3-dev (Updated: June 25, 2025)  
**License**: [TBD - Suggest MIT or Apache 2.0]  
**CI Status**: [Insert CI Badge]  
**Repository**: [https://github.com/yourname/pypm.git](https://github.com/yourname/pypm.git)

## TL;DR

`pypm` is a fast, deterministic, and hackable Python package manager designed to streamline the entire development lifecycle with a single command. Built with a ~500 LOC portable C core, it supports virtual environments, plugin extensibility, and hermetic bundles for air-gapped deployments. Think of it as a fusion of `npm`, `Cargo`, and `uv`, tailored for Python.

- **One Command**: From virtual env creation to wheel publishing.
- **Deterministic**: Reproducible installs with SHA-256 pinning.
- **Extensible**: Plugin system for custom solvers (e.g., SAT-based PMLL integration).
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on POSIX and Win32 with minimal dependencies.

## ✨ Features (v0.0.3-dev)

| Command            | Description                                      |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `pypm doctor`      | Diagnoses system (Python headers, C compiler, OpenSSL, WASI, etc.) with numeric exit codes. |
| `pypm sandbox [-d DIR]` | Launches an ephemeral shell in a temp dir (or custom `DIR`). |
| `pypm plugin add NAME SRC` | Adds a `.so` plugin from a URL or path to `~/.pypm/plugins/`. |
| `pypm plugin run NAME …` | Executes `pypm_plugin_main()` in the specified plugin. |
| `pypm pypylock [-o FILE]` | Bundles wheels and interpreter into `dist/venv.tar.gz` (or custom `FILE`). |
| `pypm version`     | Displays the current CLI version.                |

### Road-Mapped Features
- **SAT Dependency Solver**: Integrate PMLL for optimized dependency resolution.
- **Parallel Wheel Cache**: Speed up downloads with concurrent fetching.
- **Workspaces**: Single lockfile for multi-project setups.
- **WASM Wheel Resolution**: Support WebAssembly packages.
- **Conda & Poetry Import**: Plugins for ecosystem bridging.

## 🔧 Building from Source

### System Dependencies
- C11 compiler (e.g., `gcc`, `clang`)
- `libcurl` (for plugin downloads)
- `libdl` (dynamic loading, standard on Linux/macOS)
- `tar` or `libarchive` (for `pypylock` bundles, optional)

### Steps
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/pypm.git
cd pypm
cc -Wall -Wextra -ldl -lcurl -o pypm pypm.c
./pypm doctor
```

### Usage Examples
```bash
# Check your dev environment
./pypm doctor

# Start a throw-away REPL playground
./pypm sandbox
# ...hack, then exit to clean up temp dir

# Add a custom plugin (e.g., PMLL solver)
./pypm plugin add pml_solver https://example.com/plugins/pml_solver.so

# Run the plugin
./pypm plugin run pml_solver solve my_project

# Create an offline bundle
./pypm pypylock -o /tmp/my-app.tgz
```

## 📚 Extended Description

### 1. Why Another Python Package Manager?

Python’s packaging ecosystem is rich but fragmented:
- `pip` installs, `venv` isolates, `pipx` handles apps.
- `poetry`/`hatch`/`pdm` offer workflow tools, while `Conda` provides binary strength.
- Stitching these together leaves sharp edges.

`pypm` reimagines this as an **opinionated reboot**, blending:
- **npm’s Simplicity**: Single-command workflows.
- **Cargo’s Determinism**: Reproducible builds.
- **uv’s Speed**: C-powered core with <15ms startup.

| **Speed Trumps Completeness** | Parallel downloads, global cache, lazy SAT solver (PMLL-integrated). |
| **Extensibility Beats Bloat** | ~500 LOC core; plugins handle Conda, WASI, PMLL, etc. |
| **Cross-Platform Parity** | POSIX + Win32 shims, no Linux-first bias. |
| **Security First** | `pypm audit` checks OSV/CVE; `doctor` flags SSL/PGP gaps. |

   - Integrated PMLL context (SAT solver, Pages 20-23) into the architectural overview and roadmap.
   - Updated version to 0.0.3-dev with the latest release notes (June 25, 2025).
   - Clarified "&qchains" as a potential plugin or chain-related feature, leaving it open for future definition.

3. **Enhancements**:
   - Added a migration guide and known issues for better user support.
   - Improved readability with tables and bullet points.
   - Suggested licenses and a GitHub link (placeholder) for professionalism.

4. **Alignment with PMLL**:
   - Highlighted PMLL’s role in the SAT solver, tying it to the P = NP proof.
   - Proposed a PMLL plugin in the usage example, leveraging the prior Cython wrapper.

### Next Steps
- **Test**: Compile `pypm.c` and verify commands (e.g., `./pypm doctor`).
- **Enhance**: Develop a `pml_solver.so` plugin using `PMLL.c`.
- **Integrate**: Update the Python wrapper (`pypm.pyx`) to call `pypm` plugins.

Please provide `pypm.c` or feedback to refine further! Would you like to focus on plugin development or testing?
